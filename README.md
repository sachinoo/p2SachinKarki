# Interctive Car Dashboard 
 Car Dashboard has been in develping phase. It started from the tacticle switch style to touch screen and voice command based dashboard.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below are some the car dashboard design that shows how it has been evolving.

![all ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24665608/112539838-79472200-8d7f-11eb-872d-dcfbb668d953.png)

## Currently, I drive 2013 Honda Civic. Below is the dashboard configuration in my car. 

![2014_honda_civic_ex_interior_instrument_cluster_ba3c1e1ce9ee280be60300f7a3124b1c09272f6b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24665608/112540786-98927f00-8d80-11eb-8e77-c6c061ef8505.jpg)

Pros of this configuration:
 - Readability 
 -  Most of the features are clear such as the fuel indication, warning signs, and other error indication as well. 
 -  This dashboard displays all the issues currenlty in the car. It tells when is the time for oil change, tire rotation, coolant change etc.

Con of this configuration:
- When driving, the color changes which might mean something but its not known. 
- there is a traction control button on the side but upon pressin it nothing happens. 
- If the engine lights pop up, it doesn not show what is going on wrong.


For B

Some of the common features of the above mentioned dashboards are 
 - Visualization of Speed.
 - Fuel Level Reading
 - Directive lights ( Left or right Indication)
 - Odometer Reading 
 - Maintainance Indication.
 - Other features such as indicating the mechanical problems in the car system)

Othe rare uses of car dashboards are:
 - 


## Controls for interacting with car dashboard
- Cruise Control (Control, Speed up and Down)
- Media Control (Volume Up, Volume Down and  Mute)
- Handfree (Answering the call, Speed dail etc)
- Left and Right turn Indication (Blinker)
- Steerin Wheel
- Break Padle 
- Accelarator
- Gear Shifting Control
- Headlights Control 
 And so on.

 ## Common mistakes in the current Design

 ## Improvements for the design of the Dashboard

 ## Sketch for the suggested design

This design is simple as compared to the above mentioned dashboards. The new user will take no time to understand the design. It
is divided into two parts : 1. Car Information  2 . Navigation System. 
   1. The fonts looks pretty big enough for the user to read. 
   2. All the functionality of the car is availabe in one screen instead of having multiple displays which will then easily 
     distract the user.
   3. The message display helps the user to get the user feedback from the system such as of there is any error such as 
     engine maintainance then it will pop up a message in the small display.
   4. The maps / navigation system is big enough so that its easy for the naviagtion.
      These are some of the pros of this new design.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Below is the design for the dashboard that I came up with. This is a touch / physical controllable prototype of a car 
 dashboard.

Interface Components
1. Control Section
  - Digital Speedometer
  - Fuel
  - Clock
  - Temperature / Weather
  - Message Display Screen
  - Tire Pressure Measurement Display
  - Lights Control 
  - Info Section

 2. Navigation / Map Section
   - Map with navigation function

 3. Air Condition / Music Player 
  - All the a/c conrol 
  - Music player control system.

As this is a prototype, all the functions are not availbe at this moment.
